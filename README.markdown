# Folder Scanner

## Overview
This project provides a simple tool to scan all files in a directory and its subdirectories, generating an interactive HTML report (`file_scanner_results.html`). The report includes file details like type, path, name, size, and modification date, with features for searching, sorting, filtering, and opening folders directly in Windows Explorer.

The tool is distributed as a standalone executable (`folder_scanner_html_new.exe`) for Windows, so you don‚Äôt need Python installed to use it.

## Features
- **Scan Files**: Recursively scans the current directory and subdirectories for all files (excluding `.html` files).
- **Generate HTML Report**: Creates an interactive `file_scanner_results.html` with:
  - üîç Search by file name, path, or type.
  - üéØ Filter by file type using a dropdown.
  - üìä Sort by clicking column headers (e.g., file type, size).
  - üìÅ Open folder paths in Windows Explorer by clicking them.
  - üìã Copy file paths to the clipboard.
  - üíæ Export filtered results to a new file.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays a pop-up message (via `tkinter`) when the scan is complete, showing the number of files found and the path to the HTML report.
- **File Size Formatting**: Converts file sizes to human-readable formats (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
- **File Type Statistics**: Shows a summary of file types and their counts in the report.

## Download
- Download the executable: [folder_scanner_html_new.exe](link-to-your-release)
  - *Note*: Replace `link-to-your-release` with the actual GitHub release link after uploading (see below for upload instructions).

## Usage
1. **Run the Executable**:
   - Place `folder_scanner_html_new.exe` in the directory you want to scan.
   - Double-click the `.exe` to run it.
   - The tool will scan the directory and its subdirectories.

2. **View Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, a pop-up will confirm the creation of `file_scanner_results.html`.
   - Open `file_scanner_results.html` in your web browser to view the interactive report.

3. **Interact with the Report**:
   - Use the search bar to find files.
   - Filter by file type using the dropdown.
   - Click column headers to sort.
   - Click blue folder paths to open them in Windows Explorer.
   - Click "Copy" buttons to copy folder paths to your clipboard.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows (the `.exe` is Windows-compatible).
- **Dependencies**: None! The `.exe` is standalone and includes all necessary libraries.

## Notes
- The tool skips `.html` files during scanning to avoid including its own output.
- If the pop-up message fails to appear (e.g., due to `tkinter` issues), the script will print a confirmation to the console instead.
- The HTML report includes a background logo and uses the Calibri font for a polished look.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for macOS and Linux by providing platform-specific executables.
- Allow users to specify a custom directory to scan (currently scans the directory where the `.exe` is located).
- Include more export options (e.g., CSV, JSON).
